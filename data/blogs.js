The Umundu Artivism is a creation of the vision bearer, Miss Lynnet Wawira. 
The term "Umundu" means being humane, which is a Native term originating from the Embu community in Kenya.
Our mission is to shelter hearts, embrace dreams, and build futures through artivism.

Miss Lynnet Wawira has always felt the need to use art to communicate powerful messages to society.
Being a creative, she discovered that she could use films, photography, stage plays, music bands, drawings, paintings, and blogs among other creative media to spread messages of awareness.

According to Miss Lynnet Wawira, the society needs healing from:
- All forms of Gender-Based Violence
- Police brutality
- Youth Unemployment
- Discrimination of women and Persons Living with Disabilities
- ‚Ä¶and many other injustices

Through the creative content produced by The Umundu Artivism, we will educate on how and where one may find help when they fall victim to the above injustices.

We work with the criminal justice system, healthcare, education, legal sectors, and other organizations (both governmental and non-governmental) to fight these injustices.

The Umundu Artivism will also nurture talents identified during awareness creation ‚Äî acting as mentors and linking identified creatives to prominent industry bodies.

We Look Forward to Interacting With You (the Reader) as We Create Awareness and Nurture Talents.

1 in every 3 women and 1 in every 4 men globally have been sexually assaulted at some point in their lives.

**COMMON MYTHS AND FACTS ABOUT RAPE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT**
- Myth: You can spot a rapist by their appearance  
  Fact: Rapists look normal and non-threatening.
- Myth: If you did not fight back, you must have entertained the idea  
  Fact: During an assault, your body and brain get numb, making it impossible to act.
- Myth: Victims contribute to their assault by their dress code or actions  
  Fact: Rapists choose victims based on vulnerability, not appearance.
- Myth: It is not rape if the offender is your Intimate Partner  
  Fact: If your partner forces intercourse against your will, it is rape.

**STEPS TO HEALING FROM RAPE OR SEXUAL TRAUMA**

- Stay connected ‚Äî avoid isolation and engage in healthy social activities.  
- Nurture yourself ‚Äî engage in hobbies and activities that help you rediscover self-worth.

**NB:** Healing starts from within. Avoid triggers and embrace what makes you happy.

The Menstrual Hygiene Awareness Campaign aims to empower women and girls to embrace their natural cycle with dignity.
By raising awareness, we challenge stereotypes and promote equal opportunities.

‚ÄúIt is rather unfortunate that learning has to stop for some girls when receiving their monthly period.‚Äù

We conduct menstrual hygiene campaigns among teenage girls ‚Äî educating them on proper hygiene, safe disposal, and access to dignity kits comprising sanitary towels, soap, and essential supplies.
